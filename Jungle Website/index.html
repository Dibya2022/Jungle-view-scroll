        The word jungle originates from the Sanskrit word jaṅgala (Sanskrit:
        जङ्गल), meaning rough and arid. It came into the English language via
        Hindi in the 18th century.[1][2] Jāṅgala has also been variously
        transcribed in English as jangal, jangla, jungal, and juṅgala.[citation
        needed] Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry land, it has been
        suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as
        a dense "tangled thicket",[3] while others have argued that a cognate
        word in Urdu derived from Persian, جنگل (Jangal), did refer to
        forests.[4] The term is prevalent in many languages of the Indian
        subcontinent, and the Iranian Plateau, where it is commonly used to
        refer to the plant growth replacing primeval forest or to the unkempt
        tropical vegetation that takes over abandoned areas.[5] <br /><br />
        Because European explorers initially travelled through tropical forests
        largely by river, the dense tangled vegetation lining the stream banks
        gave a misleading impression that such jungle conditions existed
        throughout the entire forest. As a result, it was wrongly assumed that
        the entire forest was impenetrable jungle.[17][18] This in turn appears
        to have given rise to the second popular usage of jungle as virtually
        any humid tropical forest.[19] Jungle in this context is particularly
        associated with tropical rain forest,[8][20] but may extend to cloud
        forest, temperate rainforest, and mangroves[19][21] with no reference to
        the vegetation structure or the ease of travel. The terms "tropical
        forest" and "rainforest" have largely replaced "jungle" as the
        descriptor of humid tropical forests, a linguistic transition that has
        occurred since the 1970s. "Rainforest" itself did not appear in English
        dictionaries prior to the 1970s.[22] The word "jungle" accounted for
        over 80% of the terms used to refer to tropical forests in print media
        prior to the 1970s; since then it has been steadily replaced by
        "rainforest",[23] although "jungle" still remains in common use when
        referring to tropical rainforests.[22] <br /><br />
        As a metaphor, jungle often refers to situations that are unruly or
        lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be "survival of the
        fittest". This reflects the view of "city people" that forests are such
        places. Upton Sinclair gave the title The Jungle (1906) to his famous
        book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the
        workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful
        recourse.[24] The term "The Law of the Jungle" is also used in a similar
        context, drawn from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894)—though in
        the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant
        as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate
        code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a
        lawless chaos. The word "jungle" carries connotations of untamed and
        uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the
        emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation
        and immobilisation.[23][25][26] The change from "jungle" to "rainforest"
        as the preferred term for describing tropical forests has been a
        response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and
        spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker
        connotations of "jungle".[23][27][28] Cultural scholars, especially
        post-colonial critics, often analyse the jungle within the concept of
        hierarchical domination and the demand western cultures often places on
        other cultures to conform to their standards of civilisation. For
        example: Edward Said notes that the Tarzan depicted by Johnny
        Weissmuller was a resident of the jungle representing the savage,
        untamed and wild, yet still a white master of it;[29] and in his essay
        "An Image of Africa" about Heart of Darkness Nigerian novelist and
        theorist Chinua Achebe notes how the jungle and Africa become the source
        of temptation for white European characters like Marlowe and Kurtz.[30]
        Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak compared Israel to "a villa in
        the jungle", a comparison which had been often quoted in Israeli
        political debates. Barak's critics on the left side of Israeli politics
        strongly criticised the comparison.[31][32][33] <br /><br />
